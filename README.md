# Costellos Adventure
Costello is a nice, sweet and fluffy bird. But not when it comes to his natural enemies... BRICKS. He is here to explore more than 10 different worlds (+1 as preset for customization) with you and to destroy them all! See how he manages in this Arkanoid/Breakout like game to use many powers and to collect as much food as possible. 

It is also quite simple to add some levels, designs, or even worlds to the game!

## Getting Started / Installing

You only need to download a copy of the project to a local folder or a folder on your server. Just navigate to the index.html on your folders basepath. It is as simple as that!

### Prerequisites

You only need a functional browser. We don't gurantee that it will work in every browser when you use it on your filesystem. It turns out that actually Edge works very well if you want to do so. But it is recommended to start the game on a server. Here is a perk: If you set up a server, you can also play the game on your mobile devices browser.

##Costumization
If you want to customize this game, we have good news for you. Everything is exchangeable. You just have to change the [worlds.json](https://github.com/b3neter/CostellosAdventure/tree/master/gamelogic/level/worlds.json).

### Add a Level
Make sure you have a `level.json` in one of the [world folders](https://github.com/b3neter/CostellosAdventure/tree/master/gamelogic/level/). :warning: please name the level consecutive starting with level1 till level9999+ and further on :warning: 

to make it accessible just choose a world and add your level in the `levels` array.  

```
{
    "worlds": [
        { "name": "garden_customs" , "rank": 0 , "levels": [ "level1", "level2", "level3"], ... },
        ....
}
```

your level is accessible by typing `/gamelogic/game.html?world=RANKOFYOURWORLD?level=NUMBEROFYOURLEVEL`

### Add a World 
Just add a new Folder in the [world folders](https://github.com/b3neter/CostellosAdventure/tree/master/gamelogic/level/). :warning: also here obey the syntax. It is `"world"+ consecutive number+"_"+WORLDNAME` :warning:

now just add the world as new Array in the [worlds.json](https://github.com/b3neter/CostellosAdventure/tree/master/gamelogic/level/worlds.json). And add your Levels like above in your Folder for your World.

```
{
    "worlds": [
        ....
        { "name": "YOURWORLDSNAME" , "rank": YOURWORLDSNUMBER , "levels": [ "level1", "level2", "level3"], ... },
        ....
}
```

Also you have to set 2 new images in the [backgrounds folder](https://github.com/b3neter/CostellosAdventure/tree/master/assets/images/backgrounds/). One which will be dynamic and one which will be a layer above and static.

### Customize Worlds
All the things in your [worlds.json](https://github.com/b3neter/CostellosAdventure/tree/master/gamelogic/level/worlds.json) make the game costumizable. Just change the `bgmusic` for example there is plenty of music in the [music folder](https://github.com/b3neter/CostellosAdventure/tree/master/assets/audio/music/) for this purpose. Colors, images etc can be changed too by that;
