# Costellos Adventure
Costello is a nice, sweet and fluffy bird. But not when it comes to his natural enemies... BRICKS. He is here to explore more than 10 different worlds (+1 as preset for customization) with you and to destroy them all! See how he manages in this Arkanoid/Breakout like game to use many powers and to collect as much food as possible. 

It is also quite simple to add some levels, designs, or even worlds to the game!

## Getting Started / Installing

You only need to download a copy of the project to a local folder or a folder on your server. Just navigate to the index.html on your folders basepath. It is as simple as that!

### Prerequisites

You only need a functional browser. We don't gurantee that it will work in every browser when you use it on your filesystem. It turns out that actually Edge works very well if you want to do so. But it is recommended to start the game on a server. Here is a perk: If you set up a server, you can also play the game on your mobile devices browser. :musical-note:
